# AZ-104 Exam Preperation
## Exam Strategies
Identify key words in the question and look for options that align with those key words, example if you see SMB, NFS in the question think of Azure Files service, if you see SAML or OAuth think of Azure Active Directory in the answer.
Use Method of elimination- eliminate all options that do not feel relevant to the question, and this will narrow down your answer to 1 or 2 options.
What is being asked: you may be given a long passage to ready make sure you read and understand what is required in the question, which is usually the last 2 lines, read the question twice and mark the question for review if you are unsure.
Guess the Answer? Never leave any question unanswered as there is no negative marking, make informed guess and move on to the next question, never go to the next page without answering the question as sometimes you can’t go back to review questions of certain sections.

## Case Study Questions
The case studies are about finding the information needed quickly rather than reading it all.
Read the question, jump to the section it mentions, grab the answer.
If the question asks which answer meets the technical requirements. You only usually need to find the one related line in the technical requirements section. The rest is just time wasting fluff.

## Time Management
Time Management is key to passing the exam, the case studies will take a lot of time to read and answer, so make sure you don’t get stuck on any question, you either know it or don’t, move on to the next one and review the questions later. Also Mind that case studies and Labs can take a lot more time than multi-choice questions. Check the clock all the times and be conscious about many questions are remaining and see time per question, so that you don't miss out on answering any questions.

## Answer all questions
Flag the questions whose answers you dont know, you will be shown those questions in last and make sure you answer them, because there is no negative marking.
